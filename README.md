# Dark Mellow for Bitwig
A dark theme for Bitwig Studio with a soft color palette. To be used with [Theme Editor by Berikai](https://github.com/Berikai/bitwig-theme-editor)

## What's included
- Main .json file to be installed with [Theme Editor](https://github.com/Berikai/bitwig-theme-editor)
- Additional Bitwig's browser icons to pair with the theme (optional)
- A Bitwig's color palette made for the theme plus 3 extra ones which I also think work well with it (optional)

**Instructions**
- Backup your files and folders!!!
- Install theme file using [Theme Editor](https://github.com/Berikai/bitwig-theme-editor)
- If you want to use the included custom icons, replace the original ones in the respective Bitwig app folders:
  - /Resources/icons/browser
  - /Resources/images/library
- For the palettes just follow official Bitwig instructions
 
## Notes
- This is my first theme and Bitwig themes are a new thing, use it at your own risk.
- Not all icons are replaced, but I tried to replace most of them, if you think more should be replaced, feel free to let me know
- I find the theme to be working best when using Midtones at 0 in Bitwig Settings, and Black Level between 0 and 50 (adjust to your liking)
